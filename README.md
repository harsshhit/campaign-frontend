Summary of Missing/Incomplete Features:

backend-
 Not Implemented:
Backend Validations:
LinkedIn URL validation for leads array
MongoDB ObjectId validation for AccountIDs
Duplicate campaign name validation
Status values don't match requirements (current: "draft", "active", "completed", "paused" vs required: "active", "inactive", "deleted")
Soft Delete:
Current implementation is hard delete
No status field for "DELETED"
GET /campaigns doesn't filter out "DELETED" campaigns
Missing Fields:
The current implementation doesn't have leads and accounts fields in the Campaign model
These fields need to be added to match the requirements
To fully implement all requirements, the following changes would be needed:
Update the Campaign model to include:
leads array with LinkedIn URL validation
accounts array with MongoDB ObjectId validation
Change status enum to match requirements
Add soft delete functionality
Add backend validations for:
LinkedIn URLs
MongoDB ObjectIds
Duplicate campaign names
Modify the delete operation to be a soft delete by:
Updating status to "deleted" instead of removing the document
Filtering out deleted campaigns in GET /campaigns
